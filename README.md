# Projet-GPU


Prime Breaker , in this project  we dig in on one of the must famous problem in math , the factorization of prime number.
Prime numbers are fundamental to the most common type of encryption used today: the ***RSA algorithm***.

## Dig in 

we develop 3 functions: 

* The first one enable to test if one number ***N*** is prime or not.
* The second that search all primes numbers below  one number passed as argument ***N***.
* And the last one that  make  a prime factorization of the number passed as argument ***N***.

We build two version of each function one using only CPU and other using CPU and GPU with CUDA. 


## Requirement  

* Gnuplot

## How to compile
> cmake . ;
> make ;
> ./PrimeBreaker
